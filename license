Hey!

RAIN has been developed during my PhD at University of California, Santa Barbara <3. 

I absolutely do NOT believe in any form of intellectual property ownerships, yet some people do.
Since we live in an ugly copy-right obsession era, please obtain the appropriate permissions from UCSB before using RAIN and its source code.


Thanks,
Ali Abbasinasab
